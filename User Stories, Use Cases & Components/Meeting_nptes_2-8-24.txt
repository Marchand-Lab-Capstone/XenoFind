Notes from meeting W Jorge on Feb 8, 2024
 - General motivation behind project - Antibodies, primarily used in theraputics & cancer treat
ment specifically. 
Antibody generation process:
ell bank storg -=working cell - mvc thaw - tflask shake - shake flask steps  biroeactor cell culture, cstr batch continual scale
- eventually do centrifugation to primary recovery in vessel functioning as purification

Year over year, follows population cap gaph, in terms of g/l on rpocess improvement
de-novo synthesis is designed to exceed classical synthesis, which involves being able to readily identify and mark specific genome sequences on antibodies that are designed
General goal : aptameer that are able to function akin to antibodies like target binding or the like
historical method involved natural selection and development within biological systems
aptamers are syntheticlaly evolved as opposed to in vitro evolution - eg, selex
In vitro evolution is not viable for xDNA/xRNA
Existing technology *theoretically* agnostic to base type
as threading through pore, ion goes past generating current that can be measured
Sequence of dna translates to signal recieved, but not derived from first principles
SOA uses ml for this rather than base scientific theory

Goal:
From nanopore traces, Can We Figure Out where there is, or wherre there might be, modified letters. Can we tell where those are from
any given raw signal. We have generated training data of a variety of forms
this was done through knowledge of exact position of each xrna in a sequence, and then see
"can we throw something at it."
iow, we have a ground truth whith which to proress.
"Detection" of modified nucleotides: recognizing that it is not ATCG
Is there something we can try to apply to solve these problems
Learn to work with the type of data for what we produce
in select cycle, enrichment is done. Millin reads, each comprised of 10,000 variants,
observed 100 times each, to develop reference 
Establish benchmarking metrics for how effective different strategies are


Agnostic of milestones: What is what you imagine using this tool to be like?
1: Contains modified base, y/n
2: Range of sequences, fine tuning the range
3: 

- these are the sequences in your dataset, each 
Takes in fast5, fastq, can read variety of bases, adopted from field of epigenetics
1-5 out of 40 to 60 modified bases, use nearest standard looking sequece, 
out of 40-60, get all but 5-6 correct 
- level of confidence score for every letter, and depending on that.
Positional probability of each base


What kind of methods wouldbe deployed to break down the reads by sequence and system
standard step is consensus building, done routine. Group up all sequences by how similar each are, and group up to call "consensus"
-Are you aware of any existing packages for consensus building?
Racone & Medaca, oxford nanopore pipelines, routinely used for assembly and consensus building
Non nanopore pipelines like euclus and vsearch are used, but that's not specifically relevant, usually used for illumina sequencing (low error rate), but not really
applicable here




Remora can be used (oxford nanopore remora, published github)
remora is ml training package that should be able to solve problem, but is way more difficult to work with
Dorado written in C, Remora written in python
Show plotting of raw data, get reads done 
EOQ: Worth thinking about, too vague a question to ask a classifier? 
Time is stochastic for hw long it takes to go through pore, duration of read is potentially useful
raw data points, ave over obs window, dwell time, sampling at 5 MHz, (double check)


If needed, we can stick to P and Z as initial xenobases
NAME IDEA: Xenobased
if there's data that could be useful , let know

Move tables: Alignment
 - If we have a reference file of a basic sequence, and a basic sequence that aligns , we can then map the respective raw signal of the sequence into the characters that are basecalled. For our purposes, not that important, but it is taling the actual bases and making a relationship betweeen signal and the chars

What do we really care about, what knowledge do we need about the nanopore sequences
Residence time due to chemical structure, naye? 
samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf
if we are doing raw basecall, we have a handfull of bits and bitmapping
stores characters of basecalls, 


Demo of current existing pipelines.

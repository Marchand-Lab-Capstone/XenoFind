# User Stories - 2/15/
The following stories are designed with the intention of aiding our understanding of what
our end goal should be, as well as what we may want our design critera and use cases are.

Case 1:
User: Dr. J. Eggbert
Dr. Eggbert is a researcher and biotech researcher, who is trying to repurpose his
existing hardware to help him with his development of atypical DNA sequences, for the future
purpose of in-vitro xenobiology. His lab partner, Dr. K. Vantas,
has sent him a handful of dna samples that Dr. Eggbert has no information on. Eggbert knows that
his existing nanopore technology isn't inherently limited to standard bases, but does not have the
time to develop his own tool to check if the samples from Vantas are modified or not, and due to
Dr. Vantas being busy, does not want to bother him about it. Eggbert is not particulray knowlegable
about software tools. 

To boil it down:
- He wants something that is capable of interpreting existing data
- He wants something that is relatively unobtrusive/not time consuming
- He wants something that can tell you if a sequence contains XNA or not
- He may want a somewhat friendly user interface.

##TODO - Jayson, fill this part out pls

Case 3:
User: York Vega 
York is an undergraduate student who has gotten in to researching biology and was tasked by her
PI with the identification of possible xenonucleobase locations in a sequence she has been given.
She doesn't have any experience with code or data science, she only knwos how to drag and drop files, and maybe enter a command into a command line. She wants an output sequence that has a simple marker of areas of interest. 

To boil it down:
- She would like to take the simplest route possible
- She is likely to input something incorrectly due to inexperience
- She wants a simple, human-readable output
- The data she has is a hectic compilation and wants it to be distilled down
